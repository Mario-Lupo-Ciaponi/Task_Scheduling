# Task_Scheduling:
This is a mini concept in which you can do various operations. I used a list as a queue(FIFO). 
You can go to the next task only if you completed the current one.

## Operations:
1. Add task. Adds task to the schedule.
2. Mark task as completed. Removes the first task(the most important one) if the schedule is not empty.
3. Show the most important task. Shows the most important task(the first one) if the schedule is not empty. If the schedule has only one task, it will it.
4. Show the least important task. Shows the least important task(the last one) if the schedule is not empty. If the schedule has only one task, it will it.
5. View Task Schedule. Shows all the tasks if the schedule is not empty.
6. Show completed tasks. If you completed any tasks, it will show you the tasks.
7. Quit. It is self-explanatory

## Purpose:
The purpose is to practice my the data structure queues(as a list), Git and GitHub skills.
